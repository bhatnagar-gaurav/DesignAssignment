In this repositiory I have provided the solution for the first assignment.
Please go through the project :

**1)  Division Fragment Screen:**
    This is the first screen shown to the user when he launches the application and is required to enter the number to be multiplied.
    
**2)  Multiplication Fragment Screen:**
     This is the second screen shown to the user showing double the value entered previously as per the requirement. 
    
**3)  Main Containier Activity Screen:**
      The main activity handles the interaction between the two screens.
